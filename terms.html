    <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
    <p>Last updated: [Insert Date]</p>

    <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>By accessing or using ChatDoc ("Service"), you agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions ("Terms"). If you
        do not agree with any part of these Terms, you may not use the Service.</p>

    <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
    <p>ChatDoc is a Software as a Service (SaaS) platform that enables users to upload files and interact with them
        through Large Language Models (LLMs) using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology.</p>

    <h2>3. User Responsibilities</h2>
    <p>You agree to use ChatDoc only for lawful purposes and in accordance with these Terms. You are responsible for
        ensuring that the content you upload does not violate any applicable laws, intellectual property rights, or
        privacy regulations. You must not use the Service to transmit harmful, offensive, or unlawful material.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Privacy and Security</h2>
    <p>Your privacy is important to us. By using ChatDoc, you agree to our Privacy Policy, which outlines how we
        collect, use, and protect your data. While we implement reasonable security measures, you acknowledge that no
        online service can be 100% secure. Users are responsible for safeguarding their account credentials.</p>

    <h2>5. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>All intellectual property related to ChatDoc, including but not limited to software, logos, and platform content
        (excluding user-uploaded files), is owned by ChatDoc and protected under applicable laws. Users retain ownership
        of the files they upload but grant ChatDoc a limited license to process those files to provide the Service.</p>

    <h2>6. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>ChatDoc and its affiliates will not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages
        arising from your use of the Service. AI-generated responses may contain inaccuracies or errors; users should
        not rely solely on outputs for critical decisions.</p>

    <h2>7. Compliance with Laws</h2>
    <p>You agree to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, including but not limited to data protection laws
        (such as GDPR, CCPA, or applicable Australian privacy laws) when using ChatDoc.</p>

    <h2>8. Subscription, Payment, and Refund Policy</h2>
    <p>Certain features of ChatDoc may require a subscription. By subscribing, you agree to the applicable fees and
        billing terms. Payments are processed through third-party payment providers. Unless otherwise stated, all
        payments are non-refundable. Users may cancel subscriptions at any time, with access continuing until the end of
        the billing cycle.</p>

    <h2>9. Termination</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to ChatDoc without prior notice if you violate these
        Terms or use the Service unlawfully. Termination does not relieve you of payment obligations incurred prior to
        termination.</p>

    <h2>10. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
    <p>Uploaded files and chat data may be retained for the duration necessary to provide the Service or as required by
        law. Users may request deletion of their data, subject to certain limitations. Please refer to our Privacy
        Policy for details.</p>

    <h2>11. Third-Party Links</h2>
    <p>The Service may contain links to third-party websites. We are not responsible for the content, policies, or
        practices of those third-party services.</p>

    <h2>12. Changes to Terms</h2>
    <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. Changes will take effect immediately upon being posted on this page.
        Continued use of ChatDoc signifies your acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>
